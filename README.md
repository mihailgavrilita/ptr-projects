A set of projects given as laboratory works for the Real Time Programming course at the Technical University of Moldova during spring of 2023.

The project tasks were developed by myself and [@alexanderosadc](https://github.com/alexanderosadc).
The prime goal of the projects was to familiarize the students with basic concepts of functional programming and the actor model, as well as stream processing.
Some tasks were left intentionally open ended, to promote communication and ingenuity.
We provide below a set of resources to consult for whoever would like to attempt this set of exercises.
